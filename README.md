This is my personalized dotfiles that I use on my machines. But what is dotfiles?
Simply, dotfiles are configuration files of Unix (and some Windows) programs that are
stored in the user's home directory. These files usually named with leading dot (`.`) hence the names are dotfiles (`.files`).

The interesting part of dotfiles are it can be shared to different machine to have
the same program configurations. Then the project like this are awesome while the
settings are personalized and opinionated, it can be inspiration for other people.
While it can be simply copy paste the dotfiles to different machines, the automation
script will be much more interesting and ease to use with just one or two to three
run scripts and all the configuration files installed. That's what the project like
this trying to achieve.

So, [fork it](https://github.com/latipun7/dotfiles/fork), customize to your personalized
settings, remove what you don't need, add what you need. Or create [new repo](https://github.com/new)
and make this repo and other dotfiles repo as inspirations.
