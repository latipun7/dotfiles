## What in this Repo

This repo contains my personal configuration for Linux, Android, and Windows
managed by amazing [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).

Currently this is designed for my **Arch Linux** as server, Arch Linux for my
daily driver desktop, **Android** via Termux, and **Windows**.
_I don't have MacOS yet, but I'm considering that too in this dotfiles._

**Important ‚ö†:** You need [nerd fonts][nerd-fonts] in your system.
Install the font of your choosing and use that font as monospace font.
Personally, I use `Cascadia Code` + `Symbols Nerd Font`.

Here's the list of what included in this dotfiles:

- [`Hyprland`](https://hyprland.org/) - Beautiful tiling Wayland compositor.
- [`LazyVim`](https://www.lazyvim.org) - NeoVim as an IDE.
- [`WezTerm`](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) - Cross-platform terminal emulator.
- [`Yazi`](https://yazi-rs.github.io/) - Blazing fast terminal file manager.
- [`tmux`](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) - Terminal multiplexer _(no Windows)_.
- [`zsh`](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) - Interactive unix-like shell _(no Windows)_.
- [`lf`](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) - Cross-platform terminal file manager.
- And [many more](./home).

## Installation

Simply run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsLS https://s.id/install-dotfiles)"
```

For _**Windows, TBA**_.
