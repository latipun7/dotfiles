## What in this Repo

This repo contains my personal configuration for Linux, Android, and Windows
managed by [chezmoi](https://chezmoi.io).
Currently this is for my Arch Linux as server, Arch Linux for my daily driver desktop,
Android via Termux, and Windows (I don't have Mac yet,
but I'm considering that too in this dotfiles).

**Important**: You need [nerd fonts][nerd-fonts] in your terminal.
Install the font of your choosing and use that font in your terminal.
Personally, I use [Cascadia Code Nerd Font][my-font].

## Installation

For \*nix, simply run:

```bash
bash -c "$(curl -fsLS https://github.com/latipun7/dotfiles/raw/main/install.sh)"
```

_For Windows, TBA_.

## Resources

Here are list of resources for you to get started dive into this kind of project,
and this list is what actually inspired me to get started with it.
